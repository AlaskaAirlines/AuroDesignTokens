Thanks for helping make Auro safe for everyone.

## Security

Alaska Airlines and the Auro team takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/).

Even though [open source repositories are outside of the scope of our bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/index.html#scope) and therefore not eligible for bounty rewards, we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you have encountered a potential security vulnerability in this project, please report it via [Alaska Airlines site security vulnerability reporting portal](https://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/site-info/report-site-security-issues).

We request that you contact us via the linked portal above and give the project contributors a chance to resolve the vulnerability and issue a new release prior to any public exposure; this helps protect the project's users, and provides them with a chance to upgrade and/or update in order to protect their applications.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
